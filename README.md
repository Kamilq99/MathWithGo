# Implementing some math tasks with golang

* 1\. Calculating the square root of a number:

\- Implement a function that calculates the square root of a number. Throw an error if the number is negative, since the square root of a negative number is not a real number.

2\. Calculating the reciprocal of a number:

\- Implement a function that returns the reciprocal of a number. Throw an error if the number is zero, since you can't divide by zero.

3\. Calculating the factorial of a number:

\- Write a function that calculates the factorial of a natural number. Throw an error if the number is negative, since factorial is only defined for non-negative numbers.

4\. Checking if a number is prime:

\- Write a function that checks if a number is prime. Throw an error if the number is less than 2, since prime numbers are defined from 2 onwards.

5\. Converting a number to another number system:

\- Write a function that converts a decimal number to another number system (e.g. binary, hexadecimal). Throw an error if the target system is less than 2 or greater than 36.

6\. Calculating the logarithm of a number:

\- Implement a function that calculates the logarithm of a given number for a given base. Throw an error if the number is non-negative or if the base is less than 2.

7\. Solving a quadratic equation:

\- Write a function that solves a quadratic equation. Throw an error if the equation has no real solutions (discriminant < 0).

8\. Evaluating an expression with parentheses:

\- Implement a function that evaluates a mathematical expression with parentheses. Throw an error if the number of opening and closing parentheses does not match.

9\. Calculating the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence:

\- Write a function that calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence. Throw an error if n is less than zero, because the index of the term must be non-negative.

10\. Checking if a number is a palindrome:

\- Implement a function that checks if a number is a palindrome (whether it is the same when read forwards and backwards). Throw an error if the number is negative, because for negative numbers, checking for palindrome is meaningless.
